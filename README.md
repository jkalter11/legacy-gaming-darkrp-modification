##  Information specific to this addon ##
With my excellent programming skills and great wifi for searching up guides quickly, combined with Randomo99's ideas, I was able to successfully create an addon that would supply all our needs and that I could manage easily. 
When Randomo99 realised we'd need more developers for bigger projects that I would never be able to do myself -  with my lack of proper knowledge of DarkRP and the GMod Lua API itself - I suggested putting this up on GitHub so developing the addon would be easier for the two of us and future developers. 
Feel free to request pulls for features you would like!
